# LuzFaltex.ConCat

LuzFaltex is a C# library for interfacing with the ConCat API. It is built to fulfil a need for robust, feature-complete, highly available and concurrent bots.

The layout of this library is heavily inspired by [Remora.Discord](https://github.com/Remora/Remora.Discord), a project with which we share many design philosophies.
